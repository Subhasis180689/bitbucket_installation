# This role will attempt to fetch and load the backup manifest from a
# remote S3 URL. On successful completion the contents of JSON or YAML
# document will be in the var `atl_backup_manifest`.
#
# PREREQUISITES:
#  * `atl_backup_manifest_url` points at the manifest.
#  * The shared home filesystem is mounted if necessary (e.g. NFS/EFS).
#  * The database has been created and the variable `db_created` is
#    registered with the result (i.e: `register: db_created`).
#
# NOTE: The actual DB/FS restore operations could potentially be split
# out into discrete roles, but currently that is not required.
#
# TODO: Support HTTPS with authentication. Deferred until after the
# initial testing release.
